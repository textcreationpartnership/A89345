            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This Intellectual facultie of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſoul hath one property, viz. that it is capable of all knowledge; and herein is the excellency of our ſoules again manifeſted, that nothing is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know all things, beſides God, the Angels, and humane Intellect; But foraſmuch as human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is ignorant of many things, and yet the Arch-philoſopher ſaith it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands all things, we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh twixt the power and act, and then there will be no contradiction; the Underſtanding knoweth not all

                  <p>In another part is handled the ſtate of the Soul of Man, not ſo much in its eſſence and Form cloged with the weight of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and body of corruption, as in its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Faculties abſtracted from Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and uſe of the body which is a more Spiritual and Divine condition, and this is the ſubject of the ſecond Book; whether we conſider the Soul abſtracted from the body in thoſe purer workings of the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, the Soul ſtill quickning and remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the body; or conſider it as the body lying in the grave, and the Soul totally and really ſeparated from it.</p>

                  <p>Miſtake me not, I doe not judge it poſsible by any humane art and Science only to attain to true wiſdome, by any light of Nature to reach to ſaving grace, or to that true light which lighteneth every man that commeth into the world, by the eye of ſenſe to come to the eye of faith; I have not ſo learned Chriſt; yet as Philoſophy is ſaid to bee hand-maid to Divinity, and the
<pb facs="tcp:169944:9"/>
Law a Schoolmaſter to bring us to Chriſt, ſo muſt the Reaſonable ſoul be judged a neceſſary inſtrument towards the attainment of ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural gifts, for as natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without Grace can never find the way to Heaven, ſo Grace is never placed but in the Reaſonable ſoul, and proves by the very ſeat which it hath taken up, that the end it hath is to be ſpiritual eye-water to make Reaſon ſee what by Nature it only cannot, but never to blemiſh Reaſon in that which it can apprehend; Grace hinders not the work of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wherein it is able to work, nor faith blemiſh the eye of Reaſon in that which it can ſee and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and doubtleſs that is very far even to the eternal power and God-head, which makes the very heathens inexcuſable; where Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is weak and cannot ſee, Grace affords an helper and inſtrument to

the eye of Reaſon, to bring to its ſight thoſe things which for want of due requiſites, as convenient diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> it was not of it ſelf able to diſcern, ſuch are all the Myſteries of Divinity, as the Trinity in Unity, and Unity in Trinity, the Hypoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Union, the Incarnation of the Son of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are <hi>ſupra captum humanum,</hi> Mans Reaſon cannot attain unto, here Faith comes in and ſupplies this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; through the proſpect of Faith Reaſon looks, and without Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Faith is uſeleſs; here Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects Reaſon, and where it is wrong ſets it right, never undermines it, may be above it, but not againſt it, nor without it. So then is it Grace, is it Faith thou ſeekeſt? thou find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt it in Humane Nature, in a reaſonable Soul; This is a gift of God proper to man onely and to no other creature; the meer Senſitive
<pb facs="tcp:169944:10"/>
creatures have not this gift of Faith, their nature is not capable of Faith, they are below it, this proſpect of Faith would nothing avail the eye of Senſe.</p>
                  <p>The meer Intellectual creatures (as Saints and Angels in Heaven) they have not need of Faith, they are above it, their Intuitive intellect needs no glaſs to ſee him whom they behold face to face; onely to Man this glaſs is given, this glaſs of Faith to the eye of Reaſon to make the ſoul ſee what by nature it cannot whilſt it is veiled and impriſoned in this mortall and fraile body; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter death Faith ceaſeth; then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the body, or out of the body, viz. before the Reſurrection whilſt the body ſleeps, or after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection when the body is raiſed to glory, and both are reconjoyned, we ſhall not need any help of Faih, but ſhall ſee him even as he is, know him

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:169944:30"/>
and accordingly they held that theſe Souls had their peculiar and diſtinct places of reſidence and abode in Man; the Vegetative they placed in the Liver, the Senſitive in the Heart, and the Rational Soul in the Brain; but this doth <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> every where confute, ſo do the generality of Philoſophers after him; <hi>Scotus, Pacius, Faber Faventinus,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>For man is certainly One, and how comes a Trinity of ſoules in the Unity of a perſon? What is it that unites man and makes him one? it muſt be his ſoul, or his body; but not his body, that's clear, for firſt the body is united and preſerved by the ſoul, not the ſoul by the body; wherefore we ſee by experience, that when the ſoul is departed out of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the body continues not long after, but turns to putrifaction. Again, man is ſaid to be one, not in reſpect of his body, but his ſoul; the body which is <hi>materia</hi> is nothing but in power, 'tis the Form which actuates and perfects; the Form gives being, and ſince <hi>ens &amp; bonum conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuntur,</hi>

                        </note> that which gives Being gives Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſoul of man gives him his being, <hi>dat hoc eſſe,</hi> the ſoul of man gives him to be one; now if there were three Forms,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:169944:31"/>
three diſtinct ſouls in man, every diſtinct Form muſt give him a diſtinct being, ſo man would not be one but three, a Monſter, a <hi>tergeminus Gerion;</hi> an opinion exploded as well in Divinity as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy. See <hi>Tertullian in lib. de anima.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But man is but One, therefore but one ſoul in man, though diſtinct in its powers and faculties; there is a Trinity of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the Unity of a Reaſonable ſoul; the Vegetative is a faculty of the Vegetative ſoul, the Senſitive of the Senſitive, and the Intellectual of the Rational ſoul; yet is there not three ſouls in man, but one ſoul.</p>
                     <p>One Individual ſoul onely in man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath dividual and diſtinct powers and faculties; one ſimple eſſence which is the Form of man diſtinguiſht into three faculties of Vegetative, Senſitive, and Intellectual; one in reſpect of its eſſence, three in reſpect of its facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
                     <p>Neither are theſe faculties one before or after another in time, but all are Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporarie, there is no Priority or Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in time (onely in order) amongſt them.</p>

three ſouls in man, are againſt this poſition, and quote the words of <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> in his Book <hi>de gener. animal. cap.</hi> 3. which are theſe, <hi>Man first lives the life of Plants, then the life of Beaſts, and afterwards the life of a Man;</hi> from whence they would infer, that one facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in time before another, and one ſucceeds another, therefore there are ſo many ſeveral and ſucceeding ſouls.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſ.</hi> But to this it may be anſwered; That becauſe the ſoul hath need of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans and Inſtruments of the body to work withall, and that theſe Inſtruments are too weak, and litle fit to exerciſe the nobleſt Operations of the ſoul in the firſt times, therefore doth the ſoul exerciſe the Operations of Vegetation firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Organs are firſt fitted and prepared, and afterwards the Operations of Senſe and Reaſon; and in this ſenſe is <hi>Aristotle</hi> to be underſtood, where he ſaith, A man firſt lives the life of Plants, then the life of a Beaſt, and afterwards the life of a Man; to wit, in the Operations of the ſoul which are in time one before a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, the Operations of the Vegetative ſoul are firſt, then of the Senſitive, and laſtly of the Rational; and that will be granted by reaſon of the defect and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:169944:32"/>
inability in the other Organs, which are not ſo ſoon fitted for the other faculties to operate; yet the faculties of the ſoul are in one inſtant of time without any Priority one of another in time, and ſo they continue after the diſſolution of the ſoul and body; though the Operations of ſome of the faculties are periſhed, becauſe the body whoſe Organs they require are periſhed; the faculties of the ſoul as well the Senſitive as Intellectual remain and abide with the ſoul after the death of man; although the Intellectual then is onely operative, as hath been elſewhere ſaid; and as we cannot ſay (and ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that the Senſitive faculty is periſhed with the body, and the Intellectual only ſurvives and abides with the ſoul, becauſe it only operates, no more truly can we affirm that the Vegetative faculty in the firſt Generation is firſt in time, becauſe it firſt operates; therefore ſaith Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, There is no Priority or Poſteriority in the faculties of the ſoul; there are none before or after other in the Generation of man; See <hi>Magirus</hi> his Comment <hi>in Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam ſuam lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>

what in Reaſon thou canſt not apprehend, with the Catholick Church, adore and believe; and the Catholick Faith is this, That we wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one God in Trinity, and Trinity in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; neither confounding the perſons, nor dividing the ſubſtance; for there is one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſon of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Ghoſt. But the God-head of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt is all one; the glory equal, the Majeſty Coeternal; Such as the Father is, ſuch is the Son, and ſuch is the Holy Ghoſt; The Father Uncreate, the Son Uncreate, and the Holy Ghoſt Uncreate; The Father Incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Son Incomprehenſible; and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt Incomprehenſible; The Father Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, the Son Eternal, and the Holy Ghoſt Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and yet they are not three Eternals, but one Eternal; as alſo there are not three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſibles, nor three Uncreated, but one Uncreated, and one Incomprehenſible; ſo likewiſe the Father is Almighty, the Son Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and the Holy Ghoſt Almighty, and yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty; ſo the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Ghoſt is God, and yet they are not three Gods, but one God; ſo likewiſe the Father is Lord, the Son is Lord, and the Holy Ghoſt Lord, and yet not three Lords, but one Lord; for like as we be compelled by Chriſtian

Verity to acknowledge every perſon by himſelf to be God and Lord, ſo we are forbidden by the Catholick Religion to ſay there be three Gods or three Lords; the Father is made of none, neither created nor begotten; the Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but Begotten; the Holy Ghoſt is of the Father and the Son, neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but Proceeding; ſo there is one Father, not three Fathers, one Son, not three Sonnes, one Holy Ghoſt, not three Holy Ghoſts; And in this Trinity none is before or after other, none is greater or leſs than another.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Vegetative is the meaneſt, but the moſt common of all the other faculties, for this is the Nature of them
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:169944:35"/>
that the Inferior may ſubſiſt without the Superior, but the Superior cannot be without the Inferior faculties; therefore where the Intellectual facultie is, there muſt needs be the Vegetative &amp; Senſitive, but where the Vegetative or Senſitive is, it doth not neceſſarily follow the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual faculty ſhould be; therefore is the Vegetative more common than the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, and the Senſitive more common than the Rational faculty; Vegetation is to Plants, Beaſts, and Men common; Senſe to Beaſts and Men, but not to Plants; Reaſon is onely proper to Man, not to Plants and Beaſts. We will begin with the loweſt and moſt common; ſo in order upwards, to the higheſt and moſt ſpecial.</p>
                     <p>The Vegetative faculty is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of life; ſo hath it been defined, <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium quo primo vivimus;</hi> but here its alſo <hi>principium motus,</hi> and hath three Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons peculiar to it ſelf, of Nouriſhment, Growth,<note place="margin">Of Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, &amp; Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> and Generation, which are the ſeveral kinds of Motion &amp; Mutation; Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and Augmentation are indeed one and the ſame Operation, though diverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered; for that food which by Concoction is turned into blood, and that blood into fleſh, is both Nutrition and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:169944:35"/>
Augmentation; onely is called Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as it preſerves the Animal, who hath a continual waſt and conſumption up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and needs a new reſtauration and recovery by this nutriment, and new converſon of food into blood, and blood into fleſh; and in as much as the Body or <hi>compoſitum</hi> hath regained by this operation of the Vegetative Faculty what it had loſt, it is called Nutrition; but in as much as more is gained than was loſt, it is called Augmentation; &amp; as they are one in operation, ſo they are in the end for which they operate, they both tend to one and the ſame end <hi>(viz.)</hi> the perfecting of the creature ſo nouriſhed, and augmented; which when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummated, thoſe operations ceaſe, &amp; the other motions of diminution and alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration come in their room; and herein they differ from the Generative operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which looks not to the conſervation of the Individual in which it is reſident, ſo much as the begetting of another like Individual, by which Propagation and continued ſeries of ſucceeding Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, the Species and forms of them may be preſerved.<note place="margin">Of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or Precrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Generative operation is more noble and divine than either of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:169944:36"/>
becauſe thereby living creatures come neareſt to Immortality and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for thereby (though the Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als periſh, for <hi>quic quid oritur moritur,</hi> and <hi>quic quid generatur corrumpitur,</hi> yet) are they in their forms preſerved from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the Species remain and abide as it were in a ſurviving kind of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, amidſt the divers mortal and ſucceeding Individuals; for there is an innate deſire and appetite in every living creature to Eternity; a Deity they all aym at, and ſince they cannot attain thereto in the ſingularity of Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, for they are all ſubject to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every Individual hath in it this faculty to procreate and beget another like it ſelf, whereby the Species is the ſame, and continued as it were unto E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity; the end then of this faculty is to beget an Individual like to it ſelf, as the Generative faculty in Man is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Man, and one Horſe begets ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the Senſitive faculties are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Motive to a place, and the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive, of which more hereafter; there are incident to this faculty (though not Inſeparably) eight Senſes, five are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, as Seeing, Hearing, Smelling, Taſting, Touching, and three Internal, as the common Senſe, Phantaſie, Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; of theſe in their order, but firſt of Senſe in general, and of its properties, whereby it is diſtinguiſht from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two faculties of the Soul, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which hath been handled, and Intellective, which hereafter comes to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, It differeth from the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative, for, firſt the Vegetative hath no External Objects which it perceiveth or knoweth; its Objects are onely Internal, it diſcerneth nothing out of it ſelf: but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:169944:42"/>
but the Senſitive facultie diſcerneth and judgeth of divers and various Objects which are all External and not in the Senſe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Again the Vegetative is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent upon its Object, and not Patient, as for example, the Nutritive facultie works upon its Object, <hi>(viz.)</hi> food, which it receives, by turning food into it own likeneſs; but is not worked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it, is not converted into its ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude: but the Senſitive faculty <hi>recipien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do patitur,</hi> receives its Object, and in that Receipt is Patient, and converted to that Actually which before it was not, but Potentially.</p>
                     <p>Again, it differeth from the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual, for that judgeth and diſcerneth of Internal Objects, and External alſo, the Senſitive onely of External; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual judgeth of things abſent, and future, as wel as of things paſt &amp; preſent, the Senſitive of things preſent, (or paſt happily) not of things future; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual knoweth all things Material, and Immaterial, as well Forms ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from matter as Form and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter together, the Senſe ſevers not Form from Matter; the Intellect knoweth Spiritual and Eternal, the Senſe onely
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:169944:42"/>
things Temporal and Corporeal.</p>
                     <p>So here, a twofold Judgement in Man, one by Senſe, which is External, and of things Material and Preſent; the other Internal by the Underſtanding of things Immaterial, Spiritual, and Future.</p>
                     <p>The Judgement of Senſe is very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful, being External,<note place="margin">The judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſe not internal; the ſenſes have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</note> and Judging of Objects meerly External; for therefore are the Senſes called External, not onely becauſe their Organs are External, but alſo for that their Objects are External, which they receive and Judge of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inward knowledge or Senſe of themſelves; for there is no Senſe of the Senſes, they do not perceive themſelves, nor perceive that they do perceive; the eye doth not ſee it ſelf, or ſee it ſelf to ſee; the ear doth not hear it ſelf, or hear that it doth hear; for of themſelves the Senſes are not any thing but in Power, nothing of the Act or Operation is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them. 'Tis the Object without which works upon them and brings the Act of Judging and diſcerning.</p>
                     <p>The ſight of Senſe or the Senſe of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then is outward to Judge of things External, it hath no inward principle,<note place="margin">The judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſenſe is by external objects.</note> no Internal Object to look into, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires External Objects and principles;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:169944:43"/>
and interjected mediums alſo, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is not Operative, it hath not the art of Judging at all; nor is every Object for every Senſe, but every Senſe requires his proper Object, or elſe there will be a falſe Judgement given; for the eye doth not judge of ſounds, nor the ear of colours, the palate Judgeth not of ſmells, nor the noſe of taſts; but the eye Judgeth of colours, thoſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes white and black, and the colours intermediate; the ear Judgeth of ſounds, as ſhrill and ſharp, or baſe and dull ſounds, and their intermediums; the noſe and palate are near a kin, and have Objects alike of which they Judge, the one of ſweet or bitter ſmells, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſweet or bitter taſts, and their mediums; the hand or Senſe of feeling hath its different Objects, of hot and cold, moiſt and dry, ſoft and hard, and the like, of which it paſſeth its Judgement.</p>

ſimilitude onely is received into the Senſe, abſtracted from Matter; And therefore doth <hi>Aristotle</hi> compare the Senſe to Wax, and the Object to a Seal; Now as the Wax taketh the impreſs and Form of the Seal, whether it be Iron, Braſs, Gold or Silver, but no part of the Iron, Braſs, Gold or Silver: So the ſenſe receives the Form and print of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or thing diſcerned, but no part of the matter of the Object.</p>

receive, as the eye is void of colour, and the ear of ſounds; for if the eye had Actually in it either white or black, it could not receive another from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; ſo when any ſavour or ſmell is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Organs of thoſe Senſes, it is an impediment to other ſavours and ſmells, that they either not at all, or at leaſt very weakly, are diſcerned; for <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus exiſtens prohibet alienum;</hi> that which is within keeps all others out.</p>

                     <p>The Internal do differ much from the External in the power of operation; the operation of the one is more general than the other; the External judge on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of things preſent, the Internal of

                     <p>And as the Internal are thus diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from the External Senſes, ſo are they likewiſe amongſt themſelves, both in their Situation and Operation; and firſt in their Situation.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Although they have all of them their Situation in the Brain, yet keep they their diſtinct and ſeveral ſeats in the Brain; the Common Senſe poſſeſſeth the neareſt ſeat of the Brain, which lieth in the fore part of the head called <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciput;</hi> the Memory keeps the remoteſt ſeat, which lieth in the hindermoſt part of the head called <hi>Occiput;</hi> the Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie keeps the middle part of the Brain 'twixt them both: Thus is the Brain divided into three parts or Ventricles (as the Anatomiſts obſerve) in which there be iſſues and paſſages from one part to another, which are called <hi>Meates,</hi> through which the vitall ſpirits paſs to and fro.</p>

heretofore, that there is no Senſe of the Senſes, they do not perceive themſelves; but here we muſt lay down a contrary poſition, and all this out of the rules of Natural Philoſophy, <hi>quilibet ſenſus percipit ſe ſentire,</hi> the Eye doth perceive it ſelf to ſee, the Ear to hear, and the like; and ſo the Senſes have ſenſe of their objects; to reconcile which ſeeming contradiction, we ſay the External Senſes, <hi>virtute propria,</hi> of themſelves, and by their own operation, do not perceive themſelves; yet they doe it by another power, and this is by the faculty and operation of the Internal Common Senſe, whoſe work alone is to give ſenſe to the External.</p>
                     <p>Which Common Senſe is all one with the other five, not diverſe from them; one and the ſame Senſe divided into five conjoyned in one; the five External be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſo many Rivulets ariſing from one Spring and Fountain <hi>(viz.)</hi> one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Common Senſe; and this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal being like unto the center or point in the Circle (it is <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon) from whence ſo many lines are drawn out to the circumference, which lines are united in one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual point and center; in the ſame
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:169944:50"/>
manner are the five External Senſes drawn from one, and again united in one Internal Common Senſe; the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration therefore of this Senſe, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, perceive, diſtinguiſh, and diſcern the difference of the different objects preſented to the outward Senſes, and to give ſenſe to the Senſes; and therefore it is ſeated in the fore-part of the Brain, which part is more moiſt, and ſo apteſt for reception, and is nearer to thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, whoſe ayd and aſſiſtance they moſt require, and to whom they are nearer related than the reſt.</p>

                     <p>WEE have done with thoſe Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive faculties External and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal which have power of Judgement, Knowledge and Diſcerning; we come

now to thoſe which have not this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in themſelves, but are guided by the Counſell and advice of others, being moved by the Object, good or evill, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as Phantaſie or Reaſon preſents it; the Phantaſie imagineth it good, the Appetite is ſtreight moved to deſire it; This faculty is twofold <hi>(viz.)</hi> Appeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Motive to a place. <hi>The Locall Motive Faculty is a power of the Soul moving the living creature from place to place to follow that which the Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite coveteth as good; or to ſhunne what it lottheth as hurtful;</hi> ſo that this Motive faculty is but an effect of the Appetitive, and neceſſarily follows it as the Effect doth the Cauſe; for where the Appetitive facultie is to deſire good or ſhun evill, there muſt needs be this Motive alſo from place to place; otherwiſe the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitive ſhould be given us in vain, had we not this Motive faculty to ſeek after that wee deſire, as good and pleaſant, and to avoid what wee conceive to be hurtful unto us.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> (I grant) adds another cauſe of this Motion beſides Appetite, to wit, Intellect, (and under Intellect he comprehends Senſe, to wit Phantaſie) for what ever is deſired or ſhunned is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169944:56"/>
under the notion of good or evill ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired or lothed; now this knowledge muſt either be from Reaſon or Phantaſie, for there is no knowledge but is either Senſitive or Intellectual; therefore muſt Intellect (which includes Phantaſie) be another cauſe of Motion;<note place="margin">Vide Sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rez. de me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſ diſp. <hi>35.</hi> Sect. <hi>5.</hi> part. <hi>15.</hi> fol. <hi>172.</hi>
                        </note> neither do I intend to exclude Phantaſie and Reaſon from being a cauſe; for when I mention Appetite onely as the cauſe, I do it partly becauſe Appetite is the chief, Phantaſie and Intellect are but ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate cauſes; and partly becauſe I take Appetite here in the largeſt ſenſe, as comprehending Phantaſie and Reaſon; for Appetite in general is both Senſitive and Intellectual, as ſhall be ſaid hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo this Motive faculty being but an effect of Appetite, we ſhall be the brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it, and inſiſt more largely upon the cauſe; the knowledge wherof will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily conduce to the knowledge of the effect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Appetite is a natural deſire of the Soule, by which the living creature for the cauſe of preſervation is moved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſire that which Senſe judgeth as good, or to loth that which it appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendeth evill and hurtfull;</hi> ſo that Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite is a neceſſary concomitant of Senſe,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:169944:57"/>
and follows her cloſe; for where there is Senſe, there is ſorrow and pleaſure, and where theſe are, there muſt be Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. There is a twofold Operation of Senſe; one whereby it perceives its Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as the eye beholds colour; which is the firſt and ſimple Operation of Senſe; the other, whereby, upon the precepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and apprehenſion of the Object, the Senſe is affected with ſorrow or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; this is the ſecond, and in a ſort a mixt Operation, in as much as with the Object is joyned ſorrow or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to theſe are joyned Appetite and flight, for things pleaſant we deſire after, and things grievous we flie from; but this laſt Operation belongs to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe (not to any of the External) to perceive good under the notion of good, or evill under the notion of evill, and accordingly to be affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with is the Operation of the Internal, not External Senſes; therefore it is this Common Senſe to which the Appetite is ſo nearly related, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, they differ not <hi>re,</hi> nor yet in <hi>ſubjecto,</hi> but onely <hi>ratione;</hi> not <hi>re,</hi> for they have no diſtinct being, but one and the ſame eſſence; nor yet <hi>ſubjecto,</hi> they have
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:169944:57"/>
one and the ſame ſubject, for the ſeat of Appetite is where the Internal Senſe is ſeated, to wit, in the brain; this is to be underſtood of that Appetite which is called Senſitive, and is common to man and brutes.</p>
                     <p>But there are three kinds of Appetite according to <hi>Ariſt.</hi> Appetite is divided into Luſt, Anger, and Will; Luſt is in that faculty which is called Concupiſcible; Anger in that which is called Iraſcible, and Will in that is called Intellectual; Luſt and Anger follow the judgement of Senſe, for what Senſe judgeth pleaſant and good, Luſt deſireth; and what Senſe judgeth grievous, the Iraſcible faculty rejecteth; and theſe are in brutes as well as in man; but Will followeth the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Reaſon, for ſo ſaith the rule in Philoſophy, <hi>voluntas ſequitur dictamenin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectus,</hi> deſiring and following that which Reaſon Judgeth good and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; now this Appetitive faculty is proper to Man, and is not to be found in any other creature, ſo there are but two kinds of Appetite in brutes, yet three in Man.</p>
                     <p>Or there is a twofold Appetite in Man, and but one in Beaſts; it is <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſtill, who divides Appetite into Senſitive,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:169944:58"/>
and Intellectual; the Apetite in Beaſts is altogether ſenſual, the Appetite in Man is ſometimes governed by Senſe, ſometimes by Reaſon; and therefore he diſtinguiſheth that in Man into Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence, and Will; it is called Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence when the Appetite follows the judgement of Senſe, and not of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                     <p>It is called Will when it followes the judgement of Reaſon, and not of Senſe: ſo there are two cauſes of the Motive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in Man, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Appetite and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; Appetite, to wit, Senſitive, is the onely cauſe of Locall motion in Irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal creatures, but in Rational creatures both Reaſon and Appetite; not joyntly, as if there were not this motion without the concurrence of both; but ſeverally, and a part, either of them hath this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Motion, and ſometimes we are Moved by Appetite, ſometimes by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, one while by Luſt, another while by Will; by Appetite, when Luſt and concupiſcence which is the Senſitive Appetite overcomes the Will; by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, when the Will which is the Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual Appetite, and followes the judgement, and command of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect overcomes the Concupiſcence;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:169944:58"/>
for theſe are contrary the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſo are their motions, and therfore there is a continual War in man twixt theſe two faculties, ſometimes the one, ſometimes the other gets the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſometimes Concupiſence is the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, and overcomes the Will, as in an incontinent Man it falls out, who doth contrary to that which his own Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding bids him do, according to that of the Poet—<hi>video meliora proboque, Dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riora ſequor,</hi> ſometimes the Will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Concupiſcible facultie; and that is when we do contrary to that which our Senſitive Appetite bids us do, becauſe our Underſtanding com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, and our conſciences tell us wee ought not to do it, and ſo we choſe to obey it rather than our Senſe; Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Ariſt.</hi> obſerves three motions in Man, one whereby Will and Luſt fight one with another; the ſecond motion is, that which proceedeth from the victory of the Will; the third proceedeth from the victory of Luſt; now the Reaſon of this combate and contrary motion is this; the one follows the judgement of Senſe, the other the judgement of Reaſon and Uuderſtanding; Now Senſe and Reaſon are for the moſt part of contrary Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
<pb facs="tcp:169944:59"/>
Senſe judgeth of things as they appear good or evill at preſent without any conſideration of time to come, it hath not cognizance of things future; but Reaſon hath knowledge of future times, and therefore judgeth of things not onely as they are at preſent, but as they may be hereafter; hence it comes to paſs, that Luſt which onely followes the judgement of Senſe deſires a thing as good, becauſe it is ſo at preſent, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of the evill it bringeth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but Will following Reaſon, which looketh forward at things to come, flies from that preſent good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that greater evill that doth follow it; as for example, a ſick man is a thirſt, he coveteth drink, for drink is pleaſant and good to the thirſty, as food to the hungry, and ſleep and reſt to them that are weary; but this drink will prove hurtful to him afterwards; this the Senſitive Appetite knoweth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becauſe it hath no knowledge of time to come, but Reaſon knoweth this; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Senſe moves him to drink, but Reaſon bids him forbear; thus comes there theſe two contrarie Motions and Appetites in Man; one in reſpect of Senſe and of the time preſent, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:169944:60"/>
the Operations of right Reaſon may be impedited many waies, either through the imperiouſneſs of evill affections and carnal lusts which have got the rule, or through evill habits and cuſtomes it hath acquired, and the like, but yet Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in Man as to its eſſence is perfect as well ſince as before the fall;</hi> homo eſt animal rationale, <hi>is the definition of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man as truly now as then; Man is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creature.</hi>

hath ſo much of this Intellectual power, which ſerves to struggle, to combate, and to fight with thoſe powers of Senſe and Appetite; and though it ſeldom prevail, yet it leaves a ſting of conſcience sticking like a thorn in the fleſh; becauſe in doing evill he prefers (and that wilfully) a leſſer good before a greater; the greatneſs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is by reaſon inveſtigable and may be known.</hi>

not actually know and contemplate; he hath the habit, though not the act, whilſt he ſleepeth.</p>
                     <p>The Intellect Patient in Act, is that which is reduced into act and exerciſe; ſo that it doth not not onely actually receive what formerly was but in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but alſo operates and works about thoſe things it receives, and actually Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands them; which is done when the Phantaſmes which are illuſtrated and made Intelligible by the Intellect A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent are actually received of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Intellect, by which that knowledge which formerly it had not is acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

<pb n="133" facs="tcp:169944:85"/>
not onely a ſtraight line drawn forth to point at other things, but a reflex and circular line pointing at it ſelf; It knows it ſelf by inſpection, or (if I may ſay with <hi>Plato</hi> in this <hi>Timaeus</hi>) by reflexion; for he compared the Soul that governs this World, and conſequently the Soul which governs this Microcoſm Man, (which is but a particle of that Soul which rules this Univerſe, both of them being Intellectual, and ſo may hold pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion and reſemblance) to a line wherein was Rectitude and Reflexion; and to number, which conſiſteth of Unity and Diverſity.</p>
                        <p>The Right &amp; ſtraight line of that Soul which rules the World, he made to be the Axle-tree and Diameter of the World <hi>(viz.)</hi> that imagined line reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one Pole to another, on which the World turneth about as a Wheel; the ſtraight line of the Humane Soul he made that right Operation and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Soul, procured by a certain progreſs from the eſſence (as it were by aline drawn out) to the powers and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and from them to the act and Operation of the Soul, whereby the Soul looketh and pointeth forward,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:169944:86"/>
and by a ſtraight aſpect contemplates things out of it ſelf, External.</p>
                        <p>Again, this Rectitude or right line he bended into an Orb or Globe conſiſting like numbers of Parity and Imparity, Indentity and Diverſity; This reflex line of the Worlds Soul, was in reſpect of its circular motion upon the Axle-tree of the World; The reflex line of the Humane Soul, was that Operation whereby reflecting upon it ſelf, it knew it ſelf; And this reflex line of the Soul of the World, and of Man, had in her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentity and Diverſity. The Indentity of the Worlds Soul was in reſpect of the Eighth Sphaer which the antient Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers called the <hi>primum mobile,</hi> for this Sphaer with one uniform motion is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Eaſt to VVeſt; The Diverſity conſiſted in the motion of the ſeaven Planets in their ſeveral Sphaers; So the Soul of Man had its Indentity and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity; Indentity in reſpect of its Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Intellectual faculty which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, Diverſity in reſpect of its inferior faculties.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore this Circular and Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial line of the VVorld he divided into two Circles, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Eighth Sphaer, which is by him, and the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:169944:86"/>
called <hi>primum mobile,</hi> and moves from Eaſt to VVeſt; and the Sphaer of the Planets which moves in a contrary motion to the Eighth Sphaer <hi>(viz)</hi> from VVeſt to Eaſt; and theſe two Sphaers are ſaid to bee conjoyned by two points (of the Axle-tree) cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through them <hi>(viz.)</hi> two Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al points; Again, the other Circle <hi>(viz)</hi> that which moves from Weſt to Eaſt, he ſubdivided into ſeaven Circles of ſeaven Planets, to all which he reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the Soul of Man, which is one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and as it were one Caeleſtial Sphaer, and is divided into the Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faculty anſwering in analogy to the <hi>primum mobile</hi> or Eighth Sphaer; and the Irrational faculty anſwering in ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to the Sphaer of the Planets; for this faculty is oppoſite, and contrary to the Intellectual, and moves contrary to it, as the Planets do in a Counter-motion to the Eighth Sphaer; and as in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens the ſecond Circle is ſubdivided into ſeaven Planets; ſo doth <hi>Plato,</hi> in his <hi>Timae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> ſubdivide the Irrational faculty of the Soul into ſeaven faculties, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the particular or External Senſe, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Senſe, Phantaſie, Memory the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitative, Concupiſcible, and Iraſcible faculty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="136" facs="tcp:169944:87"/>
                           <hi>As for example.</hi>

                        <figure>
                           <p>α, β. Is the Axle-tree of the World.</p>

                        </figure>
                        <p>And thus would <hi>Timaeus</hi> prove the Soul of Man to know it ſelf by Reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Inſpection into it ſelf; which though it may be true in a ſenſe, yet we are not to imagine ſuch an Inſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Intuitive Viſion of it ſelf in-this life, as the Angells and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:169944:87"/>
Souls have of themſelves; for this knowledge agreeth not with the ſtate of the Soul as long as it is joyned with this Body, being hindred of the free and perfect exerciſe of thoſe Actions, (which are Common and Eſſential to it and the ſeparated Souls) whilſt in this body of fleſh, no more than the knowledge which now it ordinarily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth, agreeth with the ſtate of the Soul departed and ſeparated from the Body.</p>
                        <p>And though <hi>idem eſt intellectus &amp; quod intelligitur, ſcientia &amp; ſcibile;</hi> yet are wee not to conceipt an Indentity of Eſſence betwixt the Underſtanding and the Object Underſtood; there is not ſuch a Conformity twixt them in Eſſence, but in Repreſentation. The Form and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is there, the Intellect receives the ſpecies of things onely, and therefore is it called <hi>forma formarum intelligibilium,</hi> and ſo there comes an Identity, not of Eſſence, but of Proportion and Form.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Soul knoweth it ſelf in this life <hi>non per eſſentiona<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> by its own ſubſtance but <hi>per ſpeciem,</hi> and without this ſpecies the Soul knoweth not it ſelf in this life; though it needeth no Intelligible Forms
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:169944:88"/>
to know its ſelf by after this life; but knoweth it ſelf, (as other ſeparated ſubſtances do themſelves) by their own ſubſtance, and not by Form.</p>
                        <p>Neither is this Intelligible Form innate and ingendred ogether with the Nature and Eſſence of the Soul; (as thoſe Forms, whereby Angels and Souls departed know one another, are, as hereafter wee ſhall ſhew) but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the Underſtanding from ſome Object Senſible conveid to the Phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, from the Phantaſie by the Operation of the <hi>intellectus agens,</hi> to our Patient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, where of Senſible they are made Intelligible Forms, ſo from Senſible Objects are produced Intelligible Forms; and without Senſe no Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; this in the ordinary way and manner of the Souls Operation in this life, we have no knowledge, no not of Immaterial and Inſenſible Eſſences, as of God, or of our own Souls, but is in a ſort deduced from Senſe; for although ſome things are not ſenſible in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet they may be ſenſible in their parts, as a Golden Mountain which wee never ſaw but Phanſie; or in their ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and Portraiture, as men abſent, or dead, are known by their Pictures;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:169944:88"/>
or by their oppoſites, as darkneſs by light, coldneſs by heat; or by their efects, as God, our own Soul, and the Vertue and Operation of natural things which are all hidden to Senſe, but known unto us by their Effects; So God and our own Souls are known to us by their Effects and Operations; whereby may be inferred, that all our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yea our Metaphyſical knowledge of abſtracted and Immaterial ſubſtances do ſpring from Senſe, and ſo the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative Intellect, neither immixt nor inſeparable from bodily Organs, but Organical and depending on Senſe, contradictory to what hath before been affirmed.</p>
                        <p>To which I anſwer; although it may be ſaid, that Immaterial and Intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Forms are drawn in a ſort from Senſe; yet it is to be noted, that Imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial things do otherwiſe depend on Senſe than things Material do; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Intellect takes its principles from Senſe, by which it is brought to the knowledge of God, arguing from the Effect to the Cauſe, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, where from the Effect he proves the Firſt mover to be Eternal, Immate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, Infinite, although I ſay our Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:169944:89"/>
may know God to be inſenſible and Immaterial even from Senſible and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Effects; which is its uſual manner and way whereby it attaineth to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge here whilſt in the body; yet it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly not onely knows thoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Effects which are ſubject to Senſe and Phantaſie, but even God himſelf, without any help of Phantaſie or Senſible repreſentation; Even ſo, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Soul of Man doth come to the knowledge of it ſelf by the Effects and Operations which it hath found in it ſelf, and ſo of Senſible are produced Intelligible Forms; yet is not the Soul dependent of the body, either in reſpect of Organ or Object, but theſe Forms are illuſtrated and made Intelligible by Vertue of the Agent Intellect, and though Phantaſie be made Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet not ſo neceſſarily, but that this Intellectual faculty may operate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the concurrence of Senſible objects, Intelligible Forms may be imprinted in the Underſtanding, though no Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſm appear, and many times through a vehement application of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to Contemplation, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of Phantaſie is weakned, yea ſometimes, though rarely, altogether

Sphaers is not difficult to demonſtrate; But that there are no more Angels than Sphaers, or if there be more, how many more, cannot be ſhewed by Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor are their certain number defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Divine Revelation; but that there are a multitude more than thoſe which move the Orbs, may eaſily be proved by the light of Reaſon. <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> brings many for the proving thereof, nor were the Heathen Philoſophers ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant hereof, as <hi>Ariſtotle, Plato, Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clitus</hi> and others; And thus much of the Knowledge which the Soul of Man hath of Saints and Angels in this life.</p>

lift up mighty Bodies, and carry them whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they pleaſe; Thus did an Angel take up</hi> Habacuc, <hi>and in a ſhort ſpace brought him to</hi> Babylon, <hi>with a Dinner for</hi> Daniel, <hi>and carried him back again into the Land of</hi> Paleſtine.</p>

that Science of the Soul, or rather Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pience which conſiſts in the ſole intuitive Intellection, or Beatifical Viſion of the divine Eſſence and Nature of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which is not <hi>per aenigma,</hi> as in this life, but <hi>facie revelata,</hi> not in his back parts onely, but the infinite Eſſence and Majeſty, the very <hi>quiddity</hi> and being of the great <hi>Iehovah,</hi> as he is in himſelf (ſo St. <hi>Iohn</hi> expreſſeth it) fully and clearly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted.</p>

                        <hi>Theſe carry a natural light in them, clear and evident, the Scriptures not ſo, yet ſuch a light as is of force to breed Faith, though not to make a perfect Knowledge; for though it be life eternal to know God,</hi>

                        <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, yet this knowledge is no more than a belief; ſince God requires not a demonſtrative knowledge of him here, but our Faith in him, and ſuch a knowledge as may fit that, we walk by faith, and not by ſight, or perfect knowledge; for Man having ſinned
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:169944:151"/>
by pride, God thought it fitteſt to humble him at the very root of the tree of knowledge, and make him deny his underſtanding, and ſubmit to Faith, or hazard his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Faith then is a Chriſtians rule, and ground of Science; now the evidence of Faith is not ſo clear as that of Reaſon,</hi> tum ratione objecti, tum ratione ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti.</p>

is, becauſe it goes higher, and ſo upon a ſafer principle than thy Reaſon or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge can in this life attain unto.</hi> Hoc in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligendum eſt, ut ſcientia certior ſit certitudine evidentiae, fides vero cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior firmitate adhaeſionis; majus lumen in ſcientia, majus robur in fide, <hi>ſaith</hi> Biel in 3 ſent. d. 23. q. 3 a. 1. <hi>Thus much and more maiſt thou find couched, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently handled by the moſt reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in God,</hi> William <hi>Lord Arch-biſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>in his book againſt</hi> Fiſher, <hi>pag.</hi> 16.</p>

                        <hi>And for certainty and aſſurance in this kind, Faith doth not only exceed all certainty that can proceed from any natural Science be it never ſo demonſtrative, but in a manner equals the very knowledge by Intuitive Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the world to come.
